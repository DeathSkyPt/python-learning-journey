# Python Learning Journey

This repository documents my complete journey of learning Python programming - from the very basics to building complex games usign **Pygame**.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- **Stage 1 - Python Fundamentals**
    This stage covers the essential building blocks of Python programming.
    It focuses on understanding variables, data types, user input, loops, conditionals, functions, and working with lists.

    Each exercise is stored in its own folder with a dedicated '.py' file.

    ## ðŸ“‚ Exercises

    ### **Exercise 1 - Hello World**
    - Prints a welcome message to the console.
    - Teaches basic syntax and 'print()' function.

    ### **Exercise 2 - User Input**
    - Asks the user for their name and age.
    - Displays the information using a **f-string**.

    ### **Exercise 3 - Calculator**
    - Reads two numbers from the user.
    - Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    - Demonstrates arithmetic operators and basic error handling for division.

    ### **Exercise 4 - Guess the Number**
    - Generates a random number between 1 and 10.
    - Asks the user to guess until they find the correct number.
    - Demonstrates loops, conditionals, and the 'random' module.

    ### **Exercice 5 - Dice Roll Simulator**
    - Simulates rolling a six-sided dice.
    - Uses a function and the 'random' module.

    ### **Exercise 6 - To-Do List**
    - Lets the user add tasks until they type 'quit'.
    - Stores tasks in a list and prints them at the end.

- **Stage 2 - Logic and Mini Projects**
    Terminal games and logic-heavy exercices.

- **Stage 3 - Pygame Basics**
    Creating windows, handling input, moving objects, simple collisions.

- **Stage 4 - Advanced Pygame**
    Complex games with sprites, animations, levels, sound, and physics.
